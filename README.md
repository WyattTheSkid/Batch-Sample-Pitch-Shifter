# Batch-Sample-Pitch-Shifter
Assumes that your input sample is the note "A2' and generates a complete set of the 88 standard notes found on a MIDI keyboard. Useful for repitching (is that even a word?) samples in bulk for creating a VST instrument.

To use follow my god awful instructions.


Step 1: find the note that your sample represents. I recommend using a spectogram like IrcamLab's "The Snail".

Step 2: Open Audacity and use the pitch shifter thing and change the pitch of your sample to A2. (don't worry if it sounds horrid it will fix itself after the script is run I promise. Although I hope you have a backup of the original sample because why wouldn't you?)

Step 3: Make a workspace folder and put the script and your sample in it

Step 4: edit the script and change "my_sample_name_should_go_here.wav" to whatever your sample is called (dont forget the .wav and make sure it IS a .wav)

Step 5: save the script and run it

Step 6: profit. :)
